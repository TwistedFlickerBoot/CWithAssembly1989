# CWithAssembly1989
C With Assembly Language typed code snippets from Brady book by Steven Holzner.
This repo is setup for me to practice Git and GitHub for my hobby. I am
going through an old book for history and geeky fun. I figured I would make
a repo to add the code to my GitHub and it also helps muscle memory by
practicing. 

The way the book is written, not all of the code snippets will be typed.
The snippets that are complete I.E. filer.c will be typed up uploaded. 

I am using Dos 6.22 with Microsoft QuickC 2.0. I do have MASM 5.1
installed on the machine. It is running on PCem17 with a Socket 7
Intel 233Mhz with MMX and 32MB of memory. Below is the mem output
of that machine: 

Memory Type        Total  =   Used  +   Free
----------------  -------   -------   -------
Conventional         640K       23K      617K
Upper                 91K       86K        5K
Reserved             384K      384K        0K
Extended (XMS)    31,653K    2,317K   29,336K
----------------  -------   -------   -------
Total memory      32,768K    2,810K   29,958K

Total under 1 MB     731K      109K      622K

Largest executable program size       617K (631,744 bytes)  
Largest free upper memory block         5K   (4,976 bytes)  
MS-DOS is resident in the high memory area.

The book is setup for QuickC or TurboC.
The snippets may be available on archive, I did not look. I figured
I needed the practice.

Although I have discovered it is possible to get a very duck taped network
setup for contributing to GitHub directly from Dos 6.22. It was too much of
a hassle if wanting to compile on the same machine. I wouldn't consider it
good for production even if it did work.
