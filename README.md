# CWithAssembly1989
C With Assembly Language typed code snippets from Brady book by Steven Holzner.
This repo is setup for me to practice Git and GitHub for my hobby. I am
going through an old book for history and geeky fun. I figured I would make
a repo to add the code to my GitHub and it also helps muscle memory by
practicing. 

ISBN: 0-13-010968-1

The way the book is written, not all of the code snippets will be typed.
The snippets that are complete I.E. filer.c will be typed up and uploaded. 

I am using Dos 6.22 with Microsoft QuickC 2.0. I do have MASM 5.1
installed on the machine. It is running on PCem17 with a Socket 7
Intel 233Mhz with MMX and 32MB of memory. 

The book is setup for QuickC or TurboC.
The snippets may be available on archive, I did not look. I figured
I needed the practice.

Although I have discovered it is possible to get a very duck taped network
setup for contributing to GitHub directly from Dos 6.22. It was too much of
a hassle if wanting to compile on the same machine. I wouldn't consider it
good for production even if it did work. I am typing the code in vscode
on my local machine. Then I move the files over to compile, build, and test
on the DOS machine.
